    <para id="import-auto-idm380279136">This book has been specifically designed for this course out of free-and-open resources such as the OpenStax College Physics textbook (<link url="https://openstax.org/details/college-physics"><emphasis effect="underline">https://openstax.org/details/college-physics</emphasis></link>), University of Maryland’s UMD NEXUS Wikibook (<link url="http://umdberg.pbworks.com/w/page/90716129/Working%20content%20I%20(2015)"><emphasis effect="underline">http://umdberg.pbworks.com/w/page/90716129/Working%20content%20I%20(2015)</emphasis></link> and <link url="http://umdberg.pbworks.com/w/page/104048687/Working%20content%20II%20(2016)"><emphasis effect="underline">http://umdberg.pbworks.com/w/page/104048687/Working%20content%20II%20(2016)</emphasis></link>), as well as other resources from around the internet. While the text has all the information you need, some sections are also available as videos on our course YouTube page LINK. These sections will have the link at the beginning with the section below. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm963774112">Many students often complain that physics lectures, “spend all of their time on the easy problems and never have time to work through harder ones.” In this course, we want to make sure that you have time to work through harder ideas and problems in-class where you can get help from the TAs and instructor. To make sure we have time to explore these concepts, you will need to have some familiarity with basic facts before coming to class. We will expect you to learn the relevant formulas, symbols, and terminology as well as review relevant material from 131 before coming to class. We will NOT expect you to learn how to solve new types of advanced problems. This style of class, with the expectation of completing readings first is called a <emphasis effect="italics">flipped classroom</emphasis> and is based on research (Stoltzfus, Matthew W. “Active Learning in the Flipped Classroom: Lessons Learned and Best Practices To Increase Student Engagement.” In <emphasis effect="italics">The Flipped Classroom Volume 1: Background and Challenges</emphasis>, 1223:105–22. ACS Symposium Series 1223. American Chemical Society, 2016.<link url="https://doi.org/10.1021/bk-2016-1223.ch008"><emphasis effect="underline"/></link><link url="https://doi.org/10.1021/bk-2016-1223.ch008"><emphasis effect="underline">https://doi.org/10.1021/bk-2016-1223.ch008</emphasis></link>.) There will also be homework to help you learn this material, the details of which we be described in-class and/or in the syllabus. Finally, at the beginning of each unit, there will be a quiz to ensure you are ready for the in-class activities. If you complete and understand the reading and homework, you should be ready for these quizzes. The purpose of this book is to help you be ready for these homework and quizzes. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm955777360">This book, like the course, is divided into units. Each unit will begin with a “Unit on a Page” which summarizes the key points of the unit, both prep and in-class, on a single page. Due to the constraint of fitting on a single page, these pages are necessarily dense. The goal is to help you focus on the underlying themes, see what is really important. I would recommend you print these pages and keep them with you both during your prep and in-class to help you see the big picture. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm954796096">After the “Unit on a Page” there will typically be an introduction to the unit followed by the sections. Within these sections, there will be UMass-Amherst Instructor’s Notes like the one below which will tell you exactly what you need to focus on to be ready for the quizzes. </para>
